## Rock, Paper, and Scissors Game 🎮

📌 Project Overview
This is a Python-based Rock, Paper, and Scissors game where a player competes against the computer.
The game uses Python loops to allow continuous play until the player chooses to exit.
It demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

------

## 🎯 Features
Play against the computer.
Randomized computer moves using the random module.
Loop-based gameplay – play multiple rounds without restarting the program.
Score tracking for player and computer.
User-friendly input and output messages.

-------

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3
Random module for generating computer choices
While loops for continuous gameplay

-----

## 📝 Game Rules
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both player and computer choose the same, it’s a tie.

-------

## 📜 Concepts Learned
While loops for repeating actions until a condition is met.
Conditionals (if, elif, else) for decision-making.
Random module for unpredictable outcomes.
String comparison for evaluating player vs. computer moves.
